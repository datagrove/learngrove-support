## Listing a Resource
<Steps>
1. Access the List Resource page:
    * https://learngrove.co/posts/createpost
    * Main Menu > List Resource ***Must already have a creator account for option to be available***
    * [Creator Profile](https://learngrove.co/creator/profile) > List Resource Button
2. Create a Title and Description
3. Add Images
    * You may add up to 5 images to your listing
    * Hint: The first image you upload will be the primary image users see when searching for resources
4. Select Subjects, Grade Level, and Resource Type
    * Accurately representing your resource will make it easier for users to find it
5. Determine if your resource is a secular resource or not
    <Aside type="tip">Check the tool tips for more information on determining whether your resource is secular</Aside>
6. Determine the price for your resource
    * If you choose to charge for your resource you will need to select a [tax code](/creators-taxes#tax-codes).
7. Upload your Resource files. 
    <Aside type="caution">You will not be able to edit your resource files once you save as a draft or list your resource</Aside>
8. List your Resource!
    <Aside type="tip">You can also "save as draft" to edit later, but be sure to upload your resource files first!</Aside>
</Steps>

## Editing Resources

### How do I change a listed Resource?
<Steps>
1. Visit the Item Details page for your post by clicking the card for that resource from the resource catalog, or the list of resources on your profile.
2. Click the "Edit" button

3. Make changes as needed
    * ***Once your resource is created you will not be able to edit the file attachments this is to ensure that users that have already purchased the item have access to the exact files they purchased*** If you need to modify your resource file or files please create a new listing or reach out to [support](mailto:support@learngrove.co) if needed.
