## Sales Tax

### Sales Tax Collection
Datagrove operates LearnGrove and collects sales tax as a marketplace in the following jurisdictions:

**United States**
- New York (all subdivisions)
- Pennsylvania (all subdivisions)

Sellers are responsible for being aware of and in compliance with all sales tax requirements in their jurisdiction including but not limited to registration, filing, remittance, etc. Please review the [Terms](https://learngrove.co/terms) for additional detail.

### Tax Codes
#### Why Do I need to select a tax code?
Stripe requires that all items have a tax category assigned so that sales tax can be properly calculated. As stated in the Terms, LearnGrove only calculates, collects, and remits sales tax in states where we have a Marketplace Collection Agreement, however every item listed still needs an appropriate tax category. It is your responsibility as the listing creator to select the most appropriate category for your resource. For specific guidance, we always recommend speaking with a tax professional.

#### Which tax code should I select?
Stripe provides a “General - Electronically Supplied Services” category, but we recommend you carefully consider if your resource fits in any of the following categories, or any other Stripe tax category, before using the General category:

Digital other news or documents
Digital Photographs/Images
Digital Audio Visual Works
Digital Audio Works
Digital School Textbooks

Digital Magazines/Periodicals

Codes on the create resource page are listed in full with their descriptions for accuracy when choosing a tax category.***

#### My resource doesn't fit any of the tax codes provided
If you feel the appropriate tax code for your resource is available on the list of all [Stripe tax categories](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/tax-codes) but not available on LearnGrove please contact [support@learngrove.co](mailto:support@learngrove.co) and we will be happy to assist you.

## Income Tax
Creators are responsible for reporting income from LearnGrove in accordance with any local, state, or federal laws. Creators can get information about their sales and income from their Stripe Dashboard. It is solely the responsibility of the Creators to ensure they are in compliance with tax requirements in their jurisdiction. Depending on the amount of sales Stripe may issue creators required tax forms which include copies filed with the IRS.
